# TECHYSDX-RASOMWARE
Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed with the intent to encrypt a user's files or lock them out of their computer system, rendering the data inaccessible. Perpetrators behind ransomware attacks then demand a ransom, usually in cryptocurrency, from the victim in exchange for the decryption key or to regain access to system.

To create ransomware modules in Python, you would typically need the following:

1. **Python 3**: This is the programming language you'll use to write your ransomware modules. You can download Python 3 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **pip3**: `pip` is the package installer for Python. When you install Python 3, `pip` is often installed along with it. However, depending on your operating system and Python installation, you might need to specifically use `pip3` to install packages for Python 3. 

To install packages using `pip3`, you would typically use the command:
```
pip3 install python3
```

Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install.

Keep in mind the ethical and legal considerations of creating ransomware. It's highly unethical and often illegal to create and distribute ransomware, as it can cause significant harm to individuals and organizations. Instead, consider using your programming skills for constructive and ethical purposes.
